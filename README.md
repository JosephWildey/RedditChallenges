# RedditChallenges
These are my solutions to programming challenges I find on Reddit. They aren't always the most efficient solutions,
but they are my own. I try to write tons of comments to help others understand. 

I'm also not necessarily looking for the most efficient answer anyway. I'm a hobbyist programmer and try to have fun
with the stuff I write.
